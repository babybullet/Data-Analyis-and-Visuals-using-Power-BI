# Data-Analyis-and-Visuals-using-Power-BI
This project is all about producing a numbers of new data columns from the existing records with the help of Power BI and also viualizations have been imprinted for the same.
We have to work process wise if you are dealing with any kind of datasets at any software you use. 

## Step 1
Firstly, I transformed all the tables and made new columns into that existing
table in the data view tab. Like, for table named "AW_Calender" i inserted new columns like start of a week, particular year, months and many more things.

## Step 2
Secondly, I started my work with making calculated columns and measures with the help of DAX expressions in Power BI Itself. 
One of the most important tip here in DAX formulation is, never use calculated columns for aggregator functions or calculation, Instead use measures as
it is filter based context variable.

## Step 3
Thirdly, For the visualization part, I found Power BI as the best tool among other such as MS exceland tableau because it has a wide range of templates and pre defined 
conditions which makes the visualization part more easier and smooth.

## Software used-
